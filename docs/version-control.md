**Drawbacks**

1. <b>Maintaining separate files</b>

   We have to maintain separate files which is not scalable. We want a system which could do version control within a single file.

2. <b>Collaboration</b>
   Since files only exist in my computer , its difficult to collaborate.

3. <b>Reliability</b>
   There is a single point of failure. We want a system which is distributed to avoid single point of failure
