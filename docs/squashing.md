## Squashing

To "squash" in Git means to combine multiple commits into one.

**When to Squash ?**

Depends on what you have decided as a team. Instead of many individual commits which might be unnecessary only a single commit appears in the main commit history. This can be helpful in keeping commit history clean!

**How to squash**

**_Using Interactive Rebase_**

```
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```
